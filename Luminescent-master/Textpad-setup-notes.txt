How to set up Textpad (the Windows text editor) to run LMNL validation as a tool.

Other text editors will have analogous capabilities.

=== Command line setup --

Edit the batch file LMNLwf-calabash.bat
so it points to your Calabash installation.

=== Textpad setup --

Set up for running Calabash from Textpad to validate LMNL syntax files:

Under Preferences/Tools add a tool; mine is called "LMNL syntax wf check".
Select "Program" and point the tool at the batch file in this distribution, LMNLwf-calabash.bat.
(I.e. the same file you would run at the command line.)

Having added the tool, OK through and then come back to drill into the new branch for the tool settings
