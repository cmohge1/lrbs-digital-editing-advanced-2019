[line}[phr}I met a traveller from an antique land,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Who said —{phr][phr}“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone{line]
[line}Stand in the desart.[caesura}...{caesura]{phr][phr}Near them,{phr] [phr}on the sand,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Half sunk a shattered visage lies,{phr] [phr}whose frown,{phr]{line]{quatrain]
[quatrain}[line}[phr}And wrinkled lip,{phr] [phr}and sneer of cold command,{phr]{line]
[phr}[line}Tell that its sculptor well those passions read{line]
[line}Which yet survive,{phr] [phr}stamped on these lifeless things,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}The hand that mocked them,{phr] [phr}and the heart that fed;{phr]{line]{quatrain]{octave]
[sestet}[tercet}[line}[phr}And on the pedestal,{phr] [phr}these words appear:{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}My name is Ozymandias,{phr] [phr}King of Kings,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Look on my Works,{phr] [phr}ye Mighty,{phr] [phr}and despair!{phr]{line]{tercet]{s]
[tercet}[line}[s}[phr}Nothing beside remains.{phr]{s] [s}[phr}Round the decay{line]
[line}Of that colossal Wreck,{phr] [phr}boundless and bare{line]
[line}The lone and level sands stretch far away.{phr]”{line]{s]{tercet]{sestet]{sonnet]
