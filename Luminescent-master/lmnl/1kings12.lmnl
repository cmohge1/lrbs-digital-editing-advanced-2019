[verse}And he said unto them, [q}What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, [q}Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?{q]{q]{verse]
[verse}And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, [q}Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, [q=i}Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us;{q=i] thus shalt thou say unto them, [q=j}My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.{verse]
[verse}And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.{q=j]{q]{verse]
[verse}So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, [q}Come to me again the third day.{q]{verse]
