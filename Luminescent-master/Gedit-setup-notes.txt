Setting up LMNL syntax checking for gedit

(I did this under Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon. Note the same thing or something
very similar should be possible in other *nix applications.)

Under Edit/Preferences, ensure that the "External Tools" plugin is enabled.

Under Tools/Manage External Tools, create a new Tool.

I named mine "LMNL syntax check (XProc)". As a shortcut key I assigned Ctrl-Shift-L.

As the body of the external tool, provide a script like the following (with modifications):

#!/bin/sh

# FILE_URI to give to Calabash
FILE_URI=$GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_URI

# Where is Calabash on your system
CALABASH=/home/wendell/xmlcalabash-1.0.23-96/calabash.jar

# Again, URI syntax for Calabash; this is the Luminescent XProc for syntax checking.
PIPELINE=file:///home/wendell/Documents/Luminescent/LMNL-wf-check.xpl

echo LMNL syntax checking ... $FILE_URI ...
java -Xmx1024m -jar $CALABASH -dtext/plain@$FILE_URI $PIPELINE
