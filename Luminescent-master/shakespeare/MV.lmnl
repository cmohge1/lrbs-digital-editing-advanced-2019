[lmnlTEI [projectHeader}TEI in LMNL, by Wendell Piez. The text below has been transposed from
      TEI XML into LMNL syntax. Along the way, certain modifications have been made, with the result that 
      not all encoding remains in the state described in the original header (reproduced below), which 
      describes the XML source. This text is produced for purposes only of demonstrating an experimental

    [encodingDesc 
      [projectDesc}
        [p}The Folger Digital Texts project makes the texts of the  Folger Shakespeare Library editions freely available for noncommercial use. The primary goal is to represent the source text faithfully, as simply as possible within the TEI P5 schema. Lineation and other typographic features from the print edition are reproduced, with he interpretations previously implicit in the print layout now made explicit in the encoding.{p]
        [p}In addition, most elements are assigned a unique identifier. This facilitates our use of stand-off markup and provides the means for future works to point very specifically to words, lines, speeches, and arbitrary sections of the text.{p]
        [p}Please note this project offers only the encoded text and textual notes (textual notes are forthcoming). For the explanatory notes, glosses, and illustrations, refer to the print edition and/or ebook published by Simon & Schuster.{p]{projectDesc]
      [editorialDecl}
        [correction}
          [p}This XML document may include corrections and revisions made by the original Folger Edition editors. Where the text deviates from prior publications, the earlier readings are noted within critical apparatus entry tags.{p]{correction]
        [quotation}
          [p}Quotation marks (single and double quotes) are replaced with the [gi}q{gi] element, except when the quoted text refers to a name or title, in which case the [gi}name{gi] or [gi}title{gi] element is used. Apostrophes, as distinct from single quotes, are not tagged and are retained as-is within the text.{p]{quotation]
        [hyphenation [eol}hard{]}
          [p}Hyphenation is generally retained. Hyphenated words are considered to be a single word, enclosed within a single word tag ([gi}w{gi]).{p]
          [p}For all end-of-line hyphenation, the word fragments are rejoined into a single [gi}w{gi] tag. Often, the word is placed on the line where the word begins. When this would affect lineation (e.g., when the second word fragment is the only element on its line), the word is moved to the next line.{p]
          [p}Soft end-of-line hyphens (i.e., those added only because of the line break) are silently removed. Editors Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine determine whether the hyphen should be retained.{p]{hyphenation]
        [segmentation}
          [p}Acts are enclosed in [gi}div1{gi] tags. Scenes are enclosed in [gi}div2{gi] tags. Prologues, epilogues, inductions, and choruses are tagged using either [gi}div1{gi] or [gi}div2{gi], whichever is most appropriate.{p]
          [p}Page breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}pb{gi] tags.  Line breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}lb{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Speeches are enclosed in [gi}sp{gi] tags. Speech tags usually contain a speech prefix (in the [gi}speaker{gi] tag), and an anonymous block ([gi}ab{gi]) containing the text of the speech.{p]
          [p}Stage Directions are enclosed within [gi}stage{gi] tags. They may occur within or between speeches.{p]
          [p}Poems, songs, and letters are enclosed in [gi}seg{gi] tags, with the [att}type{att] attribute specifying the type. Segments split between speeches are linked through [att}next{att] and [att}prev{att] attributes. Songs that appear more separated from the text, which may or may not be attributable to a given speaker, may be enclosed in [gi}floatingText{gi] tags, which then contains the [gi}seg{gi] tag.{p]
          [p}Foreign words and phrases are enclosed in [gi}foreign{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Words, spaces, and punctuation marks are enclosed in [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags respectively.{p]
          [p}Lines (verse and prose) are not explicitly segmented. They are noted through stand-off markup.{p]{segmentation]
        [interpretation}
          [p}As much as possible, interpretations are separated from the base text. In other words, tags that offer non-essential interpretations point to, but do not enclose, [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Lineation is determined by critical judgments, complicated by accidental features of publication. While this document marks the line breaks as they appear in the Folger editions, it is understood that other projects may wish to format the text differently. Therefore, the text itself is not enclosed in any kind of line tag ([gi}l{gi] or [gi}ab{gi]). Instead, the elements of a typographic line are combined using a [gi}join{gi] tag. Using [gi}join{gi] tags allows us to maintain the Folger line numbering system and offer additional information about the verse without imposing these features on the base text. Not insignificantly, this also helps to avoid overlapping hierarchies in the XML.{p]
          [p}The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}join{gi] tags designates the line as [val}verse{val], [val}prose{val], or [val}short{val]. Verse lines may use [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes to point to other typographic lines that complete the metrical line. When it is unclear how to combine an incomplete line into a full metrical line, or when it is unclear whether the line represents verse or prose, the line is designated as [val}short{val].{p]
          [p}Identifying formal units of verse requires another interpretation. This document notes when stanzas are indicated in the edition, often by indentation. Couplets are not generally indented, and therefore, unless part of a larger formal structure, their presence is not always acknowledged.{p]
          [p}Stanzas often occur in poems and songs, but they may also be found in conversational verse. Indentations might have been noted through [att}rend{att] attributes, but this is less useful than attempting to define the structure of the stanza. However, marking verse units through [gi}lg{gi] tags is not feasible, because the text is not enclosed in [gi}l{gi] tags. Using [gi}l{gi] tags only here would be inconsistent with our encoding elsewhere and would lead to further difficulties with overlapping hierarchies (quotes spanning lines, verse lines split between speakers, etc.).{p]
          [p}Instead, pointers ([gi}ptr{gi] elements) link the typographic line (using the [gi}join{gi] tag) to a stanza definition. The [att}n{att] attribute notes the corresponding line within the stanza. If the line is split, more than one typographic line may share the same [att}n{att] attribute. The [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes point to the next lines in the stanza. Couplets are generally marked only when they appear near other {p]
          [p}Identifying exactly who participates in a given stage direction requires another interpretation. Sometimes a participant is directly named, but often, only general or ambiguous directions are given. The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}stage{gi] tag links the stage direction to the characters believed to be involved. The preference might be to use the [att}who{att] attribute, if TEI allowed this. Still, it is worth noting that judgment is involved. Ambiguity may be conveyed by linking to [gi}personGrp{gi] references. For example, it may be impossible to know how many attendants and servants are on stage, or whether the messenger in one scene is the same as the messenger in another.{p]{interpretation]{editorialDecl]

        [p}Most other elements begin with an element-specific prefix, followed by a reference to the Folger Through Line Number, a sequential numbering of the numbered lines in the text. If an element is inline with play text, it has the same line number as the line where it begins. If it begins on a line following play text, a decimal number is appended and incremented as necessary. If it falls between a speech prefix and the play text, a ".0" is appended to the value of the following line number.{p]{refsDecl]

[line [n}1.1.1{]}In sooth I know not why I am so sad.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.2{]}It wearies me, you say it wearies you.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.3{]}But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.4{]}What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.5{]}I am to learn.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.6{]}And such a want-wit sadness makes of me{line]

[line [n}1.1.15{]}Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.16{]}The better part of my affections would{line] 
[line [n}1.1.17{]}Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still{line] 
[line [n}1.1.18{]}Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.19{]}Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;{line] 
[line [n}1.1.20{]}And every object that might make me fear{line] 
[line [n}1.1.21{]}Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt{line] 
[line [n}1.1.22{]}Would make me sad. {sp] 
[sp [speaker}SALARINO{speaker]}My wind cooling my broth{line] 
[line [n}1.1.24{]}Would blow me to an ague when I thought{line] 
[line [n}1.1.25{]}What harm a wind too great might do at sea.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.26{]}I should not see the sandy hourglass run{line] 
[line [n}1.1.27{]}But I should think of shallows and of flats,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.28{]}And see my wealthy [name}Andrew{name] docked in sand,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.29{]}Vailing her high top lower than her ribs{line]

[line [n}1.1.32{]}And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.33{]}Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.34{]}Would scatter all her spices on the stream,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.35{]}Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.36{]}And, in a word, but even now worth this{line] 
[line [n}1.1.37{]}And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought{line] 
[line [n}1.1.38{]}To think on this, and shall I lack the thought{line]

[sp [speaker}BASSANIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.76{]}I will not fail you.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}GRATIANO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.77{]}You look not well, Signior Antonio.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.78{]}You have too much respect upon the world.{line]

[line [n}1.1.90{]}Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice{line] 
[line [n}1.1.91{]}By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio{line] 
[line [n}1.1.92{]}(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):{line] 
[line [n}1.1.93{]}There are a sort of men whose visages{line]

[line [n}1.1.95{]}And do a willful stillness entertain{line] 
[line [n}1.1.96{]}With purpose to be dressed in an opinion{line] 
[line [n}1.1.97{]}Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.98{]}As who should say [q}I am Sir Oracle,{line]

[line [n}1.1.102{]}For saying nothing, when, I am very sure,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.103{]}If they should speak, would almost damn those ears{line]

[line [n}1.1.126{]}Well, tell me now what lady is the same{line] 
[line [n}1.1.127{]}To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.128{]}That you today promised to tell me of?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BASSANIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.129{]}’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.130{]}How much I have disabled mine estate{line] 
[line [n}1.1.131{]}By something showing a more swelling port{line] 
[line [n}1.1.132{]}Than my faint means would grant continuance.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.133{]}Nor do I now make moan to be abridged{line] 
[line [n}1.1.134{]}From such a noble rate. But my chief care{line] 
[line [n}1.1.135{]}Is to come fairly off from the great debts{line] 
[line [n}1.1.136{]}Wherein my time, something too prodigal,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.137{]}Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.138{]}I owe the most in money and in love,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.139{]}And from your love I have a warranty{line] 
[line [n}1.1.140{]}To unburden all my plots and purposes{line] 
[line [n}1.1.141{]}How to get clear of all the debts I owe.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ANTONIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.142{]}I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;{line] 
[line [n}1.1.143{]}And if it stand, as you yourself still do,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.144{]}Within the eye of honor, be assured{line] 
[line [n}1.1.145{]}My purse, my person, my extremest means{line] 
[line [n}1.1.146{]}Lie all unlocked to your occasions.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BASSANIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.147{]}In my school days, when I had lost one shaft,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.148{]}I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight{line] 
[line [n}1.1.149{]}The selfsame way with more advisèd watch{line] 
[line [n}1.1.150{]}To find the other forth; and by adventuring both{line] 
[line [n}1.1.151{]}I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof{line] 
[line [n}1.1.152{]}Because what follows is pure innocence.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.153{]}I owe you much, and, like a willful youth,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.154{]}That which I owe is lost. But if you please{line] 
[line [n}1.1.155{]}To shoot another arrow that self way{line] 
[line [n}1.1.156{]}Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.157{]}As I will watch the aim, or to find both{line] 
[line [n}1.1.158{]}Or bring your latter hazard back again,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.159{]}And thankfully rest debtor for the first.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ANTONIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.160{]}You know me well, and herein spend but time{line] 
[line [n}1.1.161{]}To wind about my love with circumstance;{line] 
[line [n}1.1.162{]}And out of doubt you do me now more wrong{line] 
[line [n}1.1.163{]}In making question of my uttermost{line] 
[line [n}1.1.164{]}Than if you had made waste of all I have.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.165{]}Then do but say to me what I should do{line] 
[line [n}1.1.166{]}That in your knowledge may by me be done,{line]

[line [n}1.1.168{]}In Belmont is a lady richly left,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.169{]}And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.170{]}Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes{line] 
[line [n}1.1.171{]}I did receive fair speechless messages.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.172{]}Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued{line] 
[line [n}1.1.173{]}To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.174{]}Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.175{]}For the four winds blow in from every coast{line] 
[line [n}1.1.176{]}Renownèd suitors, and her sunny locks{line] 
[line [n}1.1.177{]}Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.178{]}Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,{line]

[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}Good sentences, and well pronounced.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}They would be better if well followed.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O, me, the word [q}choose{q]! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike. So is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}I pray thee, overname them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}First, there is the Neapolitan prince.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}Then is there the County Palatine.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}He doth nothing but frown, as who should say [q}An you will not have me, choose.{q] He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!—why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands! If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian; and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk. When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will if you should refuse to accept him.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure!{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}Yes, yes, it was Bassanio—as I think so was he called.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}NERISSA{speaker]}
[ab}True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PORTIA{speaker]}
[ab}I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
