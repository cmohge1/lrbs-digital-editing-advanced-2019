[lmnlTEI [projectHeader}TEI in LMNL, by Wendell Piez. The text below has been transposed from
      TEI XML into LMNL syntax. Along the way, certain modifications have been made, with the result that 
      not all encoding remains in the state described in the original header (reproduced below), which 
      describes the XML source. This text is produced for purposes only of demonstrating an experimental 
      text encoding; it is not for publication and all rights to its use remain with the Folger Library.{projectHeader]

      [projectDesc}
        [p}The Folger Digital Texts project makes the texts of the  Folger Shakespeare Library editions freely available for noncommercial use. The primary goal is to represent the source text faithfully, as simply as possible within the TEI P5 schema. Lineation and other typographic features from the print edition are reproduced, with he interpretations previously implicit in the print layout now made explicit in the encoding.{p]
        [p}In addition, most elements are assigned a unique identifier. This facilitates our use of stand-off markup and provides the means for future works to point very specifically to words, lines, speeches, and arbitrary sections of the text.{p]
        [p}Please note this project offers only the encoded text and textual notes (textual notes are forthcoming). For the explanatory notes, glosses, and illustrations, refer to the print edition and/or ebook published by Simon & Schuster.{p]{projectDesc]
      [editorialDecl}
        [correction}
          [p}This XML document may include corrections and revisions made by the original Folger Edition editors. Where the text deviates from prior publications, the earlier readings are noted within critical apparatus entry tags.{p]{correction]
        [quotation}
          [p}Quotation marks (single and double quotes) are replaced with the [gi}q{gi] element, except when the quoted text refers to a name or title, in which case the [gi}name{gi] or [gi}title{gi] element is used. Apostrophes, as distinct from single quotes, are not tagged and are retained as-is within the text.{p]{quotation]
        [hyphenation [eol}hard{]}
          [p}Hyphenation is generally retained. Hyphenated words are considered to be a single word, enclosed within a single word tag ([gi}w{gi]).{p]
          [p}For all end-of-line hyphenation, the word fragments are rejoined into a single [gi}w{gi] tag. Often, the word is placed on the line where the word begins. When this would affect lineation (e.g., when the second word fragment is the only element on its line), the word is moved to the next line.{p]
          [p}Soft end-of-line hyphens (i.e., those added only because of the line break) are silently removed. Editors Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine determine whether the hyphen should be retained.{p]{hyphenation]
        [segmentation}
          [p}Acts are enclosed in [gi}div1{gi] tags. Scenes are enclosed in [gi}div2{gi] tags. Prologues, epilogues, inductions, and choruses are tagged using either [gi}div1{gi] or [gi}div2{gi], whichever is most appropriate.{p]
          [p}Page breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}pb{gi] tags.  Line breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}lb{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Speeches are enclosed in [gi}sp{gi] tags. Speech tags usually contain a speech prefix (in the [gi}speaker{gi] tag), and an anonymous block ([gi}ab{gi]) containing the text of the speech.{p]
          [p}Stage Directions are enclosed within [gi}stage{gi] tags. They may occur within or between speeches.{p]
          [p}Poems, songs, and letters are enclosed in [gi}seg{gi] tags, with the [att}type{att] attribute specifying the type. Segments split between speeches are linked through [att}next{att] and [att}prev{att] attributes. Songs that appear more separated from the text, which may or may not be attributable to a given speaker, may be enclosed in [gi}floatingText{gi] tags, which then contains the [gi}seg{gi] tag.{p]
          [p}Foreign words and phrases are enclosed in [gi}foreign{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Words, spaces, and punctuation marks are enclosed in [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags respectively.{p]
          [p}Lines (verse and prose) are not explicitly segmented. They are noted through stand-off markup.{p]{segmentation]
        [interpretation}
          [p}As much as possible, interpretations are separated from the base text. In other words, tags that offer non-essential interpretations point to, but do not enclose, [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Lineation is determined by critical judgments, complicated by accidental features of publication. While this document marks the line breaks as they appear in the Folger editions, it is understood that other projects may wish to format the text differently. Therefore, the text itself is not enclosed in any kind of line tag ([gi}l{gi] or [gi}ab{gi]). Instead, the elements of a typographic line are combined using a [gi}join{gi] tag. Using [gi}join{gi] tags allows us to maintain the Folger line numbering system and offer additional information about the verse without imposing these features on the base text. Not insignificantly, this also helps to avoid overlapping hierarchies in the XML.{p]
          [p}The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}join{gi] tags designates the line as [val}verse{val], [val}prose{val], or [val}short{val]. Verse lines may use [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes to point to other typographic lines that complete the metrical line. When it is unclear how to combine an incomplete line into a full metrical line, or when it is unclear whether the line represents verse or prose, the line is designated as [val}short{val].{p]
          [p}Identifying formal units of verse requires another interpretation. This document notes when stanzas are indicated in the edition, often by indentation. Couplets are not generally indented, and therefore, unless part of a larger formal structure, their presence is not always acknowledged.{p]
          [p}Stanzas often occur in poems and songs, but they may also be found in conversational verse. Indentations might have been noted through [att}rend{att] attributes, but this is less useful than attempting to define the structure of the stanza. However, marking verse units through [gi}lg{gi] tags is not feasible, because the text is not enclosed in [gi}l{gi] tags. Using [gi}l{gi] tags only here would be inconsistent with our encoding elsewhere and would lead to further difficulties with overlapping hierarchies (quotes spanning lines, verse lines split between speakers, etc.).{p]
          [p}Instead, pointers ([gi}ptr{gi] elements) link the typographic line (using the [gi}join{gi] tag) to a stanza definition. The [att}n{att] attribute notes the corresponding line within the stanza. If the line is split, more than one typographic line may share the same [att}n{att] attribute. The [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes point to the next lines in the stanza. Couplets are generally marked only when they appear near other {p]
          [p}Identifying exactly who participates in a given stage direction requires another interpretation. Sometimes a participant is directly named, but often, only general or ambiguous directions are given. The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}stage{gi] tag links the stage direction to the characters believed to be involved. The preference might be to use the [att}who{att] attribute, if TEI allowed this. Still, it is worth noting that judgment is involved. Ambiguity may be conveyed by linking to [gi}personGrp{gi] references. For example, it may be impossible to know how many attendants and servants are on stage, or whether the messenger in one scene is the same as the messenger in another.{p]{interpretation]{editorialDecl]

        [p}Words, spaces, and punctuation characters are numbered sequentially, incremented by 10.{p]
        [p}Most other elements begin with an element-specific prefix, followed by a reference to the Folger Through Line Number, a sequential numbering of the numbered lines in the text. If an element is inline with play text, it has the same line number as the line where it begins. If it begins on a line following play text, a decimal number is appended and incremented as necessary. If it falls between a speech prefix and the play text, a ".0" is appended to the value of the following line number.{p]{refsDecl]

[ab}Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools, and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? [q}Better a witty Fool than a foolish wit.{q]—God bless thee, lady!{ab] {sp]

[ab}Go to, you’re a dry Fool. I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}FOOL{speaker]}
[ab}Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend. For give the dry Fool drink, then is the Fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The Lady bade take away the Fool. Therefore, I say again, take her away.{ab] {sp]
