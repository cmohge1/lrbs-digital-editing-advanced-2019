[lmnlTEI [projectHeader}TEI in LMNL, by Wendell Piez. The text below has been transposed from
      TEI XML into LMNL syntax. Along the way, certain modifications have been made, with the result that 
      not all encoding remains in the state described in the original header (reproduced below), which 
      describes the XML source. This text is produced for purposes only of demonstrating an experimental

    [encodingDesc 
      [projectDesc}
        [p}The Folger Digital Texts project makes the texts of the  Folger Shakespeare Library editions freely available for noncommercial use. The primary goal is to represent the source text faithfully, as simply as possible within the TEI P5 schema. Lineation and other typographic features from the print edition are reproduced, with he interpretations previously implicit in the print layout now made explicit in the encoding.{p]
        [p}In addition, most elements are assigned a unique identifier. This facilitates our use of stand-off markup and provides the means for future works to point very specifically to words, lines, speeches, and arbitrary sections of the text.{p]
        [p}Please note this project offers only the encoded text and textual notes (textual notes are forthcoming). For the explanatory notes, glosses, and illustrations, refer to the print edition and/or ebook published by Simon & Schuster.{p]{projectDesc]
      [editorialDecl}
        [correction}
          [p}This XML document may include corrections and revisions made by the original Folger Edition editors. Where the text deviates from prior publications, the earlier readings are noted within critical apparatus entry tags.{p]{correction]
        [quotation}
          [p}Quotation marks (single and double quotes) are replaced with the [gi}q{gi] element, except when the quoted text refers to a name or title, in which case the [gi}name{gi] or [gi}title{gi] element is used. Apostrophes, as distinct from single quotes, are not tagged and are retained as-is within the text.{p]{quotation]
        [hyphenation [eol}hard{]}
          [p}Hyphenation is generally retained. Hyphenated words are considered to be a single word, enclosed within a single word tag ([gi}w{gi]).{p]
          [p}For all end-of-line hyphenation, the word fragments are rejoined into a single [gi}w{gi] tag. Often, the word is placed on the line where the word begins. When this would affect lineation (e.g., when the second word fragment is the only element on its line), the word is moved to the next line.{p]
          [p}Soft end-of-line hyphens (i.e., those added only because of the line break) are silently removed. Editors Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine determine whether the hyphen should be retained.{p]{hyphenation]
        [segmentation}
          [p}Acts are enclosed in [gi}div1{gi] tags. Scenes are enclosed in [gi}div2{gi] tags. Prologues, epilogues, inductions, and choruses are tagged using either [gi}div1{gi] or [gi}div2{gi], whichever is most appropriate.{p]
          [p}Page breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}pb{gi] tags.  Line breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}lb{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Speeches are enclosed in [gi}sp{gi] tags. Speech tags usually contain a speech prefix (in the [gi}speaker{gi] tag), and an anonymous block ([gi}ab{gi]) containing the text of the speech.{p]
          [p}Stage Directions are enclosed within [gi}stage{gi] tags. They may occur within or between speeches.{p]
          [p}Poems, songs, and letters are enclosed in [gi}seg{gi] tags, with the [att}type{att] attribute specifying the type. Segments split between speeches are linked through [att}next{att] and [att}prev{att] attributes. Songs that appear more separated from the text, which may or may not be attributable to a given speaker, may be enclosed in [gi}floatingText{gi] tags, which then contains the [gi}seg{gi] tag.{p]
          [p}Foreign words and phrases are enclosed in [gi}foreign{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Words, spaces, and punctuation marks are enclosed in [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags respectively.{p]
          [p}Lines (verse and prose) are not explicitly segmented. They are noted through stand-off markup.{p]{segmentation]
        [interpretation}
          [p}As much as possible, interpretations are separated from the base text. In other words, tags that offer non-essential interpretations point to, but do not enclose, [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Lineation is determined by critical judgments, complicated by accidental features of publication. While this document marks the line breaks as they appear in the Folger editions, it is understood that other projects may wish to format the text differently. Therefore, the text itself is not enclosed in any kind of line tag ([gi}l{gi] or [gi}ab{gi]). Instead, the elements of a typographic line are combined using a [gi}join{gi] tag. Using [gi}join{gi] tags allows us to maintain the Folger line numbering system and offer additional information about the verse without imposing these features on the base text. Not insignificantly, this also helps to avoid overlapping hierarchies in the XML.{p]
          [p}The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}join{gi] tags designates the line as [val}verse{val], [val}prose{val], or [val}short{val]. Verse lines may use [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes to point to other typographic lines that complete the metrical line. When it is unclear how to combine an incomplete line into a full metrical line, or when it is unclear whether the line represents verse or prose, the line is designated as [val}short{val].{p]
          [p}Identifying formal units of verse requires another interpretation. This document notes when stanzas are indicated in the edition, often by indentation. Couplets are not generally indented, and therefore, unless part of a larger formal structure, their presence is not always acknowledged.{p]
          [p}Stanzas often occur in poems and songs, but they may also be found in conversational verse. Indentations might have been noted through [att}rend{att] attributes, but this is less useful than attempting to define the structure of the stanza. However, marking verse units through [gi}lg{gi] tags is not feasible, because the text is not enclosed in [gi}l{gi] tags. Using [gi}l{gi] tags only here would be inconsistent with our encoding elsewhere and would lead to further difficulties with overlapping hierarchies (quotes spanning lines, verse lines split between speakers, etc.).{p]
          [p}Instead, pointers ([gi}ptr{gi] elements) link the typographic line (using the [gi}join{gi] tag) to a stanza definition. The [att}n{att] attribute notes the corresponding line within the stanza. If the line is split, more than one typographic line may share the same [att}n{att] attribute. The [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes point to the next lines in the stanza. Couplets are generally marked only when they appear near other {p]
          [p}Identifying exactly who participates in a given stage direction requires another interpretation. Sometimes a participant is directly named, but often, only general or ambiguous directions are given. The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}stage{gi] tag links the stage direction to the characters believed to be involved. The preference might be to use the [att}who{att] attribute, if TEI allowed this. Still, it is worth noting that judgment is involved. Ambiguity may be conveyed by linking to [gi}personGrp{gi] references. For example, it may be impossible to know how many attendants and servants are on stage, or whether the messenger in one scene is the same as the messenger in another.{p]{interpretation]{editorialDecl]

        [p}Most other elements begin with an element-specific prefix, followed by a reference to the Folger Through Line Number, a sequential numbering of the numbered lines in the text. If an element is inline with play text, it has the same line number as the line where it begins. If it begins on a line following play text, a decimal number is appended and incremented as necessary. If it falls between a speech prefix and the play text, a ".0" is appended to the value of the following line number.{p]{refsDecl]

[line [n}1.1.63{]}How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.64{]}Is not this something more than fantasy?{line] 
[line [n}1.1.65{]}What think you on ’t?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HORATIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.66{]}Before my God, I might not this believe{line] 
[line [n}1.1.67{]}Without the sensible and true avouch{line] 
[line [n}1.1.68{]}Of mine own eyes. {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MARCELLUS{speaker]}Is it not like the King?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HORATIO{speaker]}
[line [n}1.1.70{]}As thou art to thyself.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.71{]}Such was the very armor he had on{line] 
[line [n}1.1.72{]}When he the ambitious Norway combated.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.73{]}So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.74{]}He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.75{]}’Tis strange.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MARCELLUS{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.76{]}Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.77{]}With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HORATIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.78{]}In what particular thought to work I know not,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.79{]}But in the gross and scope of mine opinion{line] 
[line [n}1.1.80{]}This bodes some strange eruption to our state.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MARCELLUS{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.81{]}Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.82{]}Why this same strict and most observant watch{line] 
[line [n}1.1.83{]}So nightly toils the subject of the land,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.84{]}And why such daily cast of brazen cannon{line] 
[line [n}1.1.85{]}And foreign mart for implements of war,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.86{]}Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task{line] 
[line [n}1.1.87{]}Does not divide the Sunday from the week.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.88{]}What might be toward that this sweaty haste{line] 
[line [n}1.1.89{]}Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?{line] 
[line [n}1.1.90{]}Who is ’t that can inform me? {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HORATIO{speaker]}That can I.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.92{]}At least the whisper goes so: our last king,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.93{]}Whose image even but now appeared to us,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.94{]}Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.95{]}Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.96{]}Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet{line] 
[line [n}1.1.97{]}(For so this side of our known world esteemed him){line] 
[line [n}1.1.98{]}Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.99{]}Well ratified by law and heraldry,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.100{]}Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands{line] 
[line [n}1.1.101{]}Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.102{]}Against the which a moiety competent{line] 
[line [n}1.1.103{]}Was gagèd by our king, which had returned{line] 
[line [n}1.1.104{]}To the inheritance of Fortinbras{line] 
[line [n}1.1.105{]}Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart{line] 
[line [n}1.1.106{]}And carriage of the article designed,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.107{]}His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.108{]}Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.109{]}Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there{line] 
[line [n}1.1.110{]}Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes{line] 
[line [n}1.1.111{]}For food and diet to some enterprise{line] 
[line [n}1.1.112{]}That hath a stomach in ’t; which is no other{line] 
[line [n}1.1.113{]}(As it doth well appear unto our state){line] 
[line [n}1.1.114{]}But to recover of us, by strong hand{line] 
[line [n}1.1.115{]}And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands{line] 
[line [n}1.1.116{]}So by his father lost. And this, I take it,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.117{]}Is the main motive of our preparations,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.118{]}The source of this our watch, and the chief head{line] 
[line [n}1.1.119{]}Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BARNARDO{speaker]} 
[line [n}1.1.120{]}I think it be no other but e’en so.{line] 
[line [n}1.1.121{]}Well may it sort that this portentous figure{line]

[line [n}1.1.127{]}The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead{line] 
[line [n}1.1.128{]}Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;{line] 
[line [n}1.1.129{]}As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,{line] 
[line [n}1.1.130{]}Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,{line]

[line [n}1.3.77{]}But not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),{line]

[ab}I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the Earthearth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof, fretted with golden fire—why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable; in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me, no, nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}Why did you laugh, then, when I said [q}man delights not me{q]?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}He that plays the king shall be welcome—his Majesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t. What players are they?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}No, indeed are they not.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}How comes it? Do they grow rusty?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t. These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}Faith, there has been much to-do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}Is ’t possible?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}GUILDENSTERN{speaker]}

[sp [speaker}ROSENCRANTZ{speaker]}
[ab}Ay, that they do, my lord—Hercules and his load too.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.{ab] {sp]

But it was (as I received it, and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectionaffectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much, more handsome than fine. One speech in ’t I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam’s slaughter.

[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious, periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PLAYER{speaker]}
[ab}I warrant your Honor.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theater of others. O, there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise (and that highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PLAYER{speaker]}
[ab}I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HAMLET{speaker]}
[ab}O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.

[ab}It must be [foreign [xml:lang}la{]}se offendendo{foreign]; it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three branches—it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.{ab] {sp]
