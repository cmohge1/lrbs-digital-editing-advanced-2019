[lmnlTEI [projectHeader}TEI in LMNL, by Wendell Piez. The text below has been transposed from
      TEI XML into LMNL syntax. Along the way, certain modifications have been made, with the result that 
      not all encoding remains in the state described in the original header (reproduced below), which 
      describes the XML source. This text is produced for purposes only of demonstrating an experimental 
      text encoding; it is not for publication and all rights to its use remain with the Folger Library.{projectHeader]

    [encodingDesc 
      [projectDesc}
        [p}The Folger Digital Texts project makes the texts of the  Folger Shakespeare Library editions freely available for noncommercial use. The primary goal is to represent the source text faithfully, as simply as possible within the TEI P5 schema. Lineation and other typographic features from the print edition are reproduced, with he interpretations previously implicit in the print layout now made explicit in the encoding.{p]
        [p}In addition, most elements are assigned a unique identifier. This facilitates our use of stand-off markup and provides the means for future works to point very specifically to words, lines, speeches, and arbitrary sections of the text.{p]
        [p}Please note this project offers only the encoded text and textual notes (textual notes are forthcoming). For the explanatory notes, glosses, and illustrations, refer to the print edition and/or ebook published by Simon & Schuster.{p]{projectDesc]
      [editorialDecl}
        [correction}
          [p}This XML document may include corrections and revisions made by the original Folger Edition editors. Where the text deviates from prior publications, the earlier readings are noted within critical apparatus entry tags.{p]{correction]
        [quotation}
          [p}Quotation marks (single and double quotes) are replaced with the [gi}q{gi] element, except when the quoted text refers to a name or title, in which case the [gi}name{gi] or [gi}title{gi] element is used. Apostrophes, as distinct from single quotes, are not tagged and are retained as-is within the text.{p]{quotation]
        [hyphenation [eol}hard{]}
          [p}Hyphenation is generally retained. Hyphenated words are considered to be a single word, enclosed within a single word tag ([gi}w{gi]).{p]
          [p}For all end-of-line hyphenation, the word fragments are rejoined into a single [gi}w{gi] tag. Often, the word is placed on the line where the word begins. When this would affect lineation (e.g., when the second word fragment is the only element on its line), the word is moved to the next line.{p]
          [p}Soft end-of-line hyphens (i.e., those added only because of the line break) are silently removed. Editors Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine determine whether the hyphen should be retained.{p]{hyphenation]
        [segmentation}
          [p}Acts are enclosed in [gi}div1{gi] tags. Scenes are enclosed in [gi}div2{gi] tags. Prologues, epilogues, inductions, and choruses are tagged using either [gi}div1{gi] or [gi}div2{gi], whichever is most appropriate.{p]
          [p}Page breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}pb{gi] tags.  Line breaks from the print edition are included in [gi}lb{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Speeches are enclosed in [gi}sp{gi] tags. Speech tags usually contain a speech prefix (in the [gi}speaker{gi] tag), and an anonymous block ([gi}ab{gi]) containing the text of the speech.{p]
          [p}Stage Directions are enclosed within [gi}stage{gi] tags. They may occur within or between speeches.{p]
          [p}Poems, songs, and letters are enclosed in [gi}seg{gi] tags, with the [att}type{att] attribute specifying the type. Segments split between speeches are linked through [att}next{att] and [att}prev{att] attributes. Songs that appear more separated from the text, which may or may not be attributable to a given speaker, may be enclosed in [gi}floatingText{gi] tags, which then contains the [gi}seg{gi] tag.{p]
          [p}Foreign words and phrases are enclosed in [gi}foreign{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Words, spaces, and punctuation marks are enclosed in [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags respectively.{p]
          [p}Lines (verse and prose) are not explicitly segmented. They are noted through stand-off markup.{p]{segmentation]
        [interpretation}
          [p}As much as possible, interpretations are separated from the base text. In other words, tags that offer non-essential interpretations point to, but do not enclose, [gi}w{gi], [gi}c{gi], and [gi}pc{gi] tags.{p]
          [p}Lineation is determined by critical judgments, complicated by accidental features of publication. While this document marks the line breaks as they appear in the Folger editions, it is understood that other projects may wish to format the text differently. Therefore, the text itself is not enclosed in any kind of line tag ([gi}l{gi] or [gi}ab{gi]). Instead, the elements of a typographic line are combined using a [gi}join{gi] tag. Using [gi}join{gi] tags allows us to maintain the Folger line numbering system and offer additional information about the verse without imposing these features on the base text. Not insignificantly, this also helps to avoid overlapping hierarchies in the XML.{p]
          [p}The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}join{gi] tags designates the line as [val}verse{val], [val}prose{val], or [val}short{val]. Verse lines may use [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes to point to other typographic lines that complete the metrical line. When it is unclear how to combine an incomplete line into a full metrical line, or when it is unclear whether the line represents verse or prose, the line is designated as [val}short{val].{p]
          [p}Identifying formal units of verse requires another interpretation. This document notes when stanzas are indicated in the edition, often by indentation. Couplets are not generally indented, and therefore, unless part of a larger formal structure, their presence is not always acknowledged.{p]
          [p}Stanzas often occur in poems and songs, but they may also be found in conversational verse. Indentations might have been noted through [att}rend{att] attributes, but this is less useful than attempting to define the structure of the stanza. However, marking verse units through [gi}lg{gi] tags is not feasible, because the text is not enclosed in [gi}l{gi] tags. Using [gi}l{gi] tags only here would be inconsistent with our encoding elsewhere and would lead to further difficulties with overlapping hierarchies (quotes spanning lines, verse lines split between speakers, etc.).{p]
          [p}Instead, pointers ([gi}ptr{gi] elements) link the typographic line (using the [gi}join{gi] tag) to a stanza definition. The [att}n{att] attribute notes the corresponding line within the stanza. If the line is split, more than one typographic line may share the same [att}n{att] attribute. The [att}prev{att] and [att}next{att] attributes point to the next lines in the stanza. Couplets are generally marked only when they appear near other {p]
          [p}Identifying exactly who participates in a given stage direction requires another interpretation. Sometimes a participant is directly named, but often, only general or ambiguous directions are given. The [att}ana{att] attribute of the [gi}stage{gi] tag links the stage direction to the characters believed to be involved. The preference might be to use the [att}who{att] attribute, if TEI allowed this. Still, it is worth noting that judgment is involved. Ambiguity may be conveyed by linking to [gi}personGrp{gi] references. For example, it may be impossible to know how many attendants and servants are on stage, or whether the messenger in one scene is the same as the messenger in another.{p]{interpretation]{editorialDecl]

        [p}Words, spaces, and punctuation characters are numbered sequentially, incremented by 10.{p]
        [p}Most other elements begin with an element-specific prefix, followed by a reference to the Folger Through Line Number, a sequential numbering of the numbered lines in the text. If an element is inline with play text, it has the same line number as the line where it begins. If it begins on a line following play text, a decimal number is appended and incremented as necessary. If it falls between a speech prefix and the play text, a ".0" is appended to the value of the following line number.{p]{refsDecl]

[ab}I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Aragon comes this night to Messina.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when I left him.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}But few of any sort, and none of name.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}Did he break out into tears?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}In great measure.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}What is he that you ask for, niece?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HERO{speaker]}
[ab}My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}O, he’s returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s Fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an excellent stomach.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}And a good soldier too, lady.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable virtues.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuffed man, but for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her. They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict, four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one, so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}Is ’t possible?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}I will hold friends with you, lady.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}Do, good friend.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}You will never run mad, niece.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}No, not till a hot January.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}MESSENGER{speaker]}
[ab}Don Pedro is approached.{ab] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 1.1.93.1{][}Enter Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, with Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, and John the Bastard.{]]  
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain, but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}You embrace your charge too willingly.
[stage [n}SD 1.1.101{][} Turning to Hero. {]]I think this is your daughter.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}Her mother hath many times told me so.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself.—Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.{ab] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 1.1.110.1{][}Leonato and the Prince move aside.{]] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick, nobody marks you.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}A dear happiness to women. They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humor for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentleman or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer, but keep your way, i’ God’s name, I have done.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}You always end with a jade’s trick. I know you of old.{ab] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 1.1.143.1{][}Leonato and the Prince come forward.{]] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
[stage [n}SD 1.1.151{][} To Don John.{]] Let me bid you welcome, my lord, being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}DON JOHN{speaker]}
[ab}I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}Please it your Grace lead on?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.{ab] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 1.1.157.1{][}All exit except Benedick and Claudio.{]] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I noted her not, but I looked on her.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}Is she not a modest young lady?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}No, I pray thee, speak in sober judgment.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise. Only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Would you buy her that you enquire after her?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}Can the world buy such a jewel?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There’s her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Is ’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith, an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek you.{ab] {sp]  
[stage [n}SD 1.1.199.1{][}Enter Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon.{]]  
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}What secret hath held you here that you followed not to Leonato’s?{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}I charge thee on thy allegiance.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a dumb man, I would have you think so, but on my allegiance—mark you this, on my allegiance—he is in love. With who? Now, that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}If this were so, so were it uttered.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Like the old tale, my lord: [q}It is not so, nor ’twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.{q]{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}By my troth, I speak my thought.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}That I love her, I feel.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}That she is worthy, I know.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me. I will die in it at the stake.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks. But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none. And the fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Well, as time shall try. In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead, and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write [q}Here is good horse to hire{q] let them signify under my sign [q}Here you may see Benedick the married man.{q]{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I look for an earthquake too, then.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s. Commend me to him, and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you—{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had it—{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometimes guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience. And so I leave you.{ab] {sp]

[ab}As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward.

[ab}I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am. I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.{ab] {sp]

[ab}Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.{ab] {sp]

[ab}I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking.

[ab}In faith, she’s too curst.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}

He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him. Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead his apes into hell.{ab] {sp]

[ab}Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.{ab] {sp]

[ab}The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave.{ab] {sp]

Tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret [q}Hero,{q] hear Margaret term me [q}Claudio,{q] and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding, for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent, and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}DON JOHN{speaker]}
[ab}Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.{ab] {sp]

I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.

Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.{ab] {sp]

[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear what they say of him.{ab] {sp]

[ab}Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops—{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]}
[ab}Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, he is in love.{ab] {sp]

[ab}You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern.

[ab}Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer. Do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s garments, how you disgraced her when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation.

[line [n}5.4.43{]}So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.44{]}I think he thinks upon the savage bull.{line] 
[line [n}5.4.45{]}Tush, fear not, man. We’ll tip thy horns with gold,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.46{]}And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.47{]}As once Europa did at lusty Jove{line] 
[line [n}5.4.48{]}When he would play the noble beast in love.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.49{]}Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.50{]}And some such strange bull leapt your father’s cow{line] 
[line [n}5.4.51{]}And got a calf in that same noble feat{line] 
[line [n}5.4.52{]}Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.53{]}For this I owe you. Here comes other reck’nings.{line]  
[stage [n}SD 5.4.53.1{][}Enter Leonato’s brother, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, the ladies masked.{]]  
[line [n}5.4.54{]}Which is the lady I must seize upon?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.55{]}This same is she, and I do give you her.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.56{]}Why, then, she’s mine.—Sweet, let me see your face.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.57{]}No, that you shall not till you take her hand{line] 
[line [n}5.4.58{]}Before this friar and swear to marry her.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[stage [run-in] [n}SD 5.4.59.0{][}, to Hero{]] 
[line [n}5.4.59{]}Give me your hand before this holy friar.{line] 
[stage [n}SD 5.4.59.1{][}They take hands.{]] 
[line [n}5.4.60{]}I am your husband, if you like of me.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HERO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.61{]}And when I lived, I was your other wife,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.62{]}And when you loved, you were my other husband.{line] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 5.4.62.1{][}She unmasks.{]] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.63{]}Another Hero! {sp] 
[sp [speaker}HERO{speaker]}Nothing certainer.{line] 
[line [n}5.4.65{]}One Hero died defiled, but I do live,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.66{]}And surely as I live, I am a maid.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.67{]}The former Hero! Hero that is dead!{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.68{]}She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}FRIAR{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.69{]}All this amazement can I qualify,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.70{]}When after that the holy rites are ended,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.71{]}I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.{line] 
[line [n}5.4.72{]}Meantime let wonder seem familiar,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.73{]}And to the chapel let us presently.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.74{]}Soft and fair, friar.—Which is Beatrice?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[stage [run-in] [n}SD 5.4.75.0{][}, unmasking{]] 
[line [n}5.4.75{]}I answer to that name. What is your will?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.76{]}Do not you love me? {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}Why no, no more than reason.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.78{]}Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio{line] 
[line [n}5.4.79{]}Have been deceived. They swore you did.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.80{]}Do not you love me? {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}Troth, no, no more than reason.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.82{]}Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula{line] 
[line [n}5.4.83{]}Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.84{]}They swore that you were almost sick for me.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.85{]}They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.86{]}’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.87{]}No, truly, but in friendly recompense.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.88{]}Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.89{]}And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.90{]}For here’s a paper written in his hand,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.91{]}A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.92{]}Fashioned to Beatrice. {sp]
[stage [n}SD 5.4.92{][}He shows a paper.{]] 
[sp [speaker}HERO{speaker]}And here’s another,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.94{]}Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol’n from her pocket,{line] 
[line [n}5.4.95{]}Containing her affection unto Benedick.{line] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 5.4.95.1{][}She shows a paper.{]] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}A miracle! Here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but by this light I take thee for pity.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BEATRICE{speaker]}
[ab}I would not deny you, but by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Peace! I will stop your mouth.{ab] {sp] 
[stage [n}SD 5.4.102.1{][}They kiss.{]] 
[sp [speaker}PRINCE{speaker]} 
[line [n}5.4.103{]}How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?{line] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}I’ll tell thee what, prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No. If a man will be beaten with brains, he shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it. For man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion.—For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}CLAUDIO{speaker]}
[ab}I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgeled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}LEONATO{speaker]}
[ab}We’ll have dancing afterward.{ab] {sp] 
[sp [speaker}BENEDICK{speaker]}
[ab}First, of my word! Therefore play, music.— Prince, thou art sad. Get thee a wife, get thee a wife. There is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.{ab] {sp]  
[stage [n}SD 5.4.128.1{][}Enter Messenger.{]]
