[sonnet}[octave}[s}[quatrain}[line}[phr}Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}That,{phr] [phr}bravely masked,{phr] [phr}their fancies may be told;{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Or Pindar's apes flaunt they in phrases fine,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold;{phr]{line]{quatrain]
[quatrain}[line}[phr}Or else let them in statelier glory shine,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Ennobling new-found tropes with problems old;{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Or with strange similes enrich each line,{phr]{line]
[line}[phr}Of herbs or beasts with Ind or Afric hold.{phr]{line]{quatrain]{s]{octave]

[line}But copying is,{phr] [phr}what in her Nature writes.{phr]{line]{s]{tercet]{sestet]{sonnet]{sonneteer]
