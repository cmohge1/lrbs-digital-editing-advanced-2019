## Seminar 1

### TEI primer

**Lecture notes:**

* **What is the purpose of a digital edition?**
  - Something to be read or used?
  - *Classical* and *digital thinking*: output-driven v. user-centric design (Rehbein 2010)
  - Modelling comes before editing, according to this view. This is the analytical process of establishing the editorial principles and the purpose of the edition, including its intended audience (For more on modelling, see the Day 2 notes from the [Intro module](https://cmohge1.github.io/lrbs-digital-editing-intro-2019/day2/#text-modelling).)
  - "why-what-how" approach of functional and semantic modelling. Note how the "why" question comes first.
  - declaration of principles based on the documents but also the formal computational model of the edition.
  - the tyranny of the page: think first about "page" design (traditional) or think about comutational features?
  - Wireframing:
