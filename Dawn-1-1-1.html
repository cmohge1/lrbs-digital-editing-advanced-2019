      <h2>Book I: Womb</h2>

      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>Alive!</p>

      <p>Still alive.</p>

      <p>Alive … again.</p>


      <p><span title="Root word: awaken" style="text-decoration: underline;">Awakening</span> <span title="Root word: be" style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> hard, as always. The ultimate disappointment. It <span title="Root word: is" style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> a struggle to take in enough air to drive off nightmare <span title="Root word: sensation" style="text-decoration: underline;">sensations</span> of asphyxiation. Lilith Iyapo <span title="Root word: lie" style="text-decoration: underline;">lay</span> <span title="Root word: gasp" style="text-decoration: underline;">gasping</span>, <span title="Root word: shake" style="text-decoration: underline;">shaking</span> with the force of <span title="Root word: she" style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> effort. <span title="Root word: she" style="text-decoration: underline;">Her</span> heart beat too fast, too loud. She <span title="Root word: curl" style="text-decoration: underline;">curled</span> around it, fetal, helpless. Circulation <span title="Root word: begin" style="text-decoration: underline;">began</span> to return to <span title="Root word: she" style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> <span title="Root word: arm" style="text-decoration: underline;">arms</span> and <span title="Root word: leg" style="text-decoration: underline;">legs</span> in <span title="Root word: flurry" style="text-decoration: underline;">flurries</span> of minute, exquisite <span title="Root word: pain" style="text-decoration: underline;">pains</span>.
      </p>


      <p>When her body calmed and became reconciled to reanimation, she looked around. The
         room seemed dimly lit, though she had never Awakened to dimness before. She
         corrected her thinking. The room did not only seem dim, it was dim. At an earlier
         Awakening, she had decided that reality was whatever happened, whatever she
         perceived. It had occurred to her—how many times?—that she might be insane or
         drugged, physically ill or injured. None of that mattered. It could not matter
         while she was confined this way, kept helpless, alone, and ignorant.
      </p>


      <p>She sat up, Swayed dizzily, then turned to look at the rest of the room.</p>


      <p>The walls were light-colored—white or gray, perhaps. The bed was what it had
         always been: a solid platform that gave slightly to the touch and that seemed to
         grow from the floor. There was, across the room, a doorway that probably led to a
         bathroom. She was usually given a bathroom. Twice she had not been, and in her
         windowless, doorless cubicle, she had been forced simply to choose a corner.

      <p>She went to the doorway, peered through the uniform dimness, and satisfied herself
         that she did, indeed, have a bathroom. This one had not only a toilet and a sink,
         but a shower. Luxury.
      </p>


      <p>What else did she have?</p>


      <p>Very little. There was another platform perhaps a foot higher than the bed. It
         could have been used as a table, though there was no chair And there were things
         on it. She saw the food first. It was the usual lumpy cereal or stew, of no
         recognizable flavor, contained in an edible bowl that would disintegrate if she
         emptied it and did not eat it.
      </p>


      <p>And there was something beside the bowl. Unable to see it clearly, she touched
         it.
