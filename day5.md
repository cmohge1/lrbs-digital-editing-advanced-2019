## Aims

- Understand some of the options for visualising text material.
- Understand the value of using programming languages as part of edition planning.
- Working knowledge of the basic syntax of the R programming language, and the ability to modify existing text analysis code.

### Seminar 12

#### Current web- and app-based vis tools

**Voyant Tools**

1. Go to [https://voyant-tools.org/](https://voyant-tools.org/).
2. Start by uploading the [Bad Hamlet file](bad-hamlet.xml) (click on the "Upload" icon).
![voy](voyant-vis.png).
3. What do you notice about the results?
4. Now try another file with some different encoding: [Chapters 20-21 of *Billy Budd*](billy-budd-chs20-21.xml), a heavily revised part of the manuscript.

[Click here](text-conv.xsl) for the text conversion xslt.

**AntConc**

[AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html) is a corpus linguistics tool that can be downloaded for free on your machine.

This tool is very good for providing raw word frequencies on multiple files, as well as supplying phrase-level searching and parts-of-speech tagging.
