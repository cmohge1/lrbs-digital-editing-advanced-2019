Have you taken an introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), but are unsure of what to do next? Have you started a digital edition, but want to learn more about encoding, querying, publishing and analysing your project? Taught by several scholars with years of practical editing experience, this advanced digital scholarly editing module can help take your digital editing further, showing through several hands-on workshops how to implement advanced computational methods. Students will focus on XML technologies such as advanced TEI encoding, XPath and XSLT, as well as the programming language R to produce text analyses of edition data.


Please note: Students in this module must have a basic understanding of TEI-XML. If you require an introduction to TEI, consider signing up for the LRBS module, Digital Scholarly Editing: An Introduction.
